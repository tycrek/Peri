# Welcome

Peri is a Discord bot built on Cloudflare Workers. It's a work in progress, and is currently in a very early stage of development.

The main goal is a proof-of-concept that a Discord bot can be deployed to Cloudflare Workers using the fantastic [Hono](https://hono.dev) framework. There are existing packages out there for Workers-based Discord bots, but they're typically inactive and out of date.

As of this repo being made public, the source code is officially functional. **However, consider it the earliest of alphas.** There are still many features to be added and existing features may change.
